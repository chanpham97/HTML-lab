# Unit 2: Lesson 3 – HTML Lab
Your goal is to recreate the website (image in reference.png)following the following steps. You can use any dog image.

## Steps
1. Page Setup
- Set up the HTML structure for the index.html page.
- Duplicate this file to create the moreinfo.html and about.html pages with the correct HTML structure.
2. Tab Names: Change the tab name (title) of each of the tabs to match the heading name (i.e. index.html would be Home, etc.)
3. Navigation Bar
- In index.html, create the navigation bar that connects to all three pages. You can use the pipe (|), spaces, or any other separator. 
- Copy this exact navigation bar over to the More Info and About pages so that you can move freely between pages (you should be able to see the tab name change)
4. Headers
- Add an h1 header that says “Welcome to My Website” under the navigation bar of index.html 
- Add h1 header that say “More Info” to moreinfo.html
- Add h1 header that say “About” to about.html
5. Image: Using any dog image, add the image under the header
6. Links
- Add the p tag with the text “Check out these external websites:” 
- Add the hyperlink to “https://www.compscihigh.org/” that says “Comp Sci High”
- Add the hyperlink to “https://www.google.com/” that says “Google”
7. Extra Credit (you will likely need external resources to do this)
- Change the hyperlinks to be in an unordered list. 
- Add an input field that takes in the user’s name and has a button that says “Submit”. It will look like this (1pt - 4.2):
